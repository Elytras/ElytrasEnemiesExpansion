EEE Enemy/Projectile list

One of the main motivations of making this mod was making Down Record count player kills on renamed enemies :engilaugh:
MEV/DEA assets/rebuilds used with the permissions of the authors
Some MEV materials are added with different names so that they can be used in CD2 Material control (you can ask me if you want any specific mev enemy material to be introduced)
Some enemies were duplicated with new name so they can be distinguished by name in game and their kills count in stat tracking mods, as renaming enemies in cd2 stops it from happening.


Anything with "Nightmares" after descriptor has nightmares mode added to it, which will work if you start mission with difficulty that contains "Nightmares" (case insensitive) in the name. 
In that case, some cd2 changes may not work on those enemies, because they will be overwritten by EEE. If you want some of the things to be on the base enemy, please message me (Can't do it for any of the s5 enemies though.)
    Why am i doing it this way for barragers which otherwise are just vanilla enemy? because the way they are done is essentially a cd2 way of customizing enemies, just hardcoded on enenmy.
    It is done like that because we dont have real barrage dummy due to no modkit updates for season 5
    There are some things i can change to the barrage base, but not it's attack pattern/count/behavior/etc

    On other enemies, that can be (and are actual real enemies without nightmares mode) i made sure so that EEE will overwrite anything CD2 does to the said enemy, if nightmares mode is enabled. 
    I did it because i dont want to load cd2 replication system. As much as cd2 now allows for bigger difficulties, i still prefer this way. It hides enemy changes from people yes, but i dont think it matters for anyone who is not interested about difficulty or enemy changes
    If it does matter for you though, if you are interested in exact changes per enemy, you can ask me in EEE thread on PDRG discord server. 
    If you then will be interested into that enemy not being "locked" behind nightmares mode i can add it, but most (as of writing this message - all) of the "Nightmares mode" enemies can be done via cd2, and does not require custom enemy to do so

Note: Description below will be changed/removed when time passes with updating more enemies to have "Nightmares" mode on them

2 enemy categories. Nightmares specific and general use. For the dupes at some point i will remove them and add flag to enable difficulty mode on enemy at some point. (though :engishrug: to do with things that are basic changes of vanilla enemies)
Nightmares enemies are enemies that exist specifically for my difficulty. 
They can be:
1. Unfinished(need cd2 modules/cd2 modules and/or mev/dea for projectiles)
2. Unstable
3. Too small to realistically count as full on custom enemy
4. Premade variant of something easy to do that was added only to free up space in difficulty file, has a high chance of also being a mev enemy with a rename to allow down recorder mod to count kills from it
5. Just something weird
For Nightmares enemies: 
    If you want a copy of one of them being saved in the state they are at any given point, please notify me, otherwise i may change/delete enemy from the mod for any reason. I may not notify about exact changes done to Nightmares enemies in the mod updates.

General purpose enemies are finished, ready to be used enemies that will not be changed unless enough people ask to change it (in which case i'll either edit it or add edited variant of said enemy).
